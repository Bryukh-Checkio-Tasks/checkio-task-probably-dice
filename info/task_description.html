    For this task, you're on your way to a board game convention and
    want to learn more about dice probabilities since you suspect you'll be rolling a lot of them soon.
</p>
    
<p>
    The most common way to use multiple dice is to simply roll them all and add up all the results.
    To get started with your investigation of dice, write a function that takes the number of dice,
    the number of sides per die and a target number and
    returns the probability of getting a total roll of exactly the target value.
    The result should be given with four digits precision as &plusmn;0.0001.
    For example, if you roll 2 six-sided dice, the probability of getting exactly a 3 is 2/36 or 5.56%,
    which you should return as &asymp;0.0556.

<p>
    For each test, assume all the dice are the same and are numbered from 1 to the number of sides, inclusive.
    So a 4-sided die would have an equal chance of rolling a 1, 2, 3 or 4.
    A 20-sided die would have an equal chance of rolling any number from 1 to 20.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input:</strong>
    Three arguments. The number of dice, the number of sides per die and the target number as integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output:</strong> 
    The probability of getting exactly target number on a single roll of given dice as a float.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Example:</strong>
</p>
<pre class="brush: python">
probability(2, 6, 3) == 0.0556  # 2 six-sided dice have a 5.56% chance of totalling 3
probability(2, 6, 4) == 0.0833
probability(2, 6, 7) == 0.1667
probability(2, 3, 5) == 0.2222  # 2 three-sided dice have a 22.22% chance of totalling 5
probability(2, 3, 7) == 0       # The maximum you can roll on 2 three-sided dice is 6
probability(3, 6, 7) == 0.0694
probability(10, 10, 50) == 0.0375
</pre>

    <strong>How it is used:</strong>
    <i>This task illustrates some of the basics of probability.
        Many events can be described as the combination of other events.
        In this case you're combining several dice into one total.</i>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Preconditions:</strong><br/>
    1 &le; <strong>dice_number</strong> &le; 10<br/>
    2 &le; <strong>sides</strong> &le; 20<br/>
    0 &le; <strong>target</strong> &lt; 1000
